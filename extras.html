	<p>This year I competed on the Piedmont Baseball team, we played well for most of the season. We made the playoffs as the 8th seed. We beat the 9 seed and moved on to play the 1 seed. In iconic Pidemont Fashion we beat the 1 seed which was 4 hours away. Sadly our season came to an end in the semi-finals to close battle from our friends Northeast Justin-Siena.</p>

           <p>This year I went on many trips, the highlight of all of these adventures was for sure mexico. Our local church took around 300 kids to Tijuana, Mexico to build houses for families in need. I was on peach team and we were obviously the best team. Our chemistry was unmatched and our house building skills were amazing. We built an amazing house for an amazing family, and had a great time doing it.</p>
