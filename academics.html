	<p>Sophmore year was year filled with adventures and challenges. To start the school year off I was estactic for footbal season, but I would suffer bone and ligament damage in my elbow needing 2 serious sugeries. This put me out of commmision for football season. Although this was horribly sad, I had more time to focus on school and hang with friends. I had a great time watching my friends compete in sports and being able to hang out with whoever, whenever. I also suceeded in school, as I finished the year with all A's. THankfully I was able to speed through my recovery process and was able to be healthy enough for baseball season. Overall this year was great.</p>
